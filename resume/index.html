						<h2>Director of Engineering at <a href="http://www.8thbridge.com" target="_blank">8thBridge</a></h2>
						<p class="subDetails">Match 2010 - Present</p>
						<p>At 8thBridge I have held the roles of Software Engineer, Lead Engineer, Engineering Manager and presently Director of Engineering. I started my career at 8thBridge building front-ends in Flex and ActionScript. I also spearheaded a switch from subversion to git for our version control system. In late 2011, I lead the development team during a pivot to a platform using HTML, Javascript, Python and MongoDB. I was able to quickly acclimate to a Python development environment using MongoDB as our main database. I then moved up to the Engineering Manager position, where I was responsible for 5 developers as well as leading the development of the API.</p><p>In June 2013, I was promoted to Director of Engineering. I am responsible for the entire development team, quality assurance and operations, totaling 8 direct reports. In the last 6 months the 8thBridge platform has seen an increase in traffic from 6 million daily API requests to more than 100 million. The platform has been able to scale approximately 17 times by only adding API server capacity when necessary. I often work with clients and partners to optimize the implementation of the 8thBridge platform, talking through implementation details, providing code examples and developing custom solutions when necessary.</p>

						<h2>Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.easports.com/careers/orlando" target="_blank">Electronic Arts</a></h2>
						<p class="subDetails">January 2007 - March 2010</p>
						<p>My role at EA as a User Interface Software Engineer expanded my skill set to include ActionScript and Flash. On a daily basis, I reviewed Photoshop mocks and wireframes of screens, created the necessary interface components from the Photoshop mocks, updated the ActionScript framework and tested the usability of the screens in our application. As a Lead Engineer I was also responsible for estimating future work, mentoring other team members, verifying test requirements, and creating and updating design documents.</p><p>I was also responsible for the client-server communication system written in ActionScript. On multiple projects I designed and developed varying client-server communications systems. Our team decided to use XML based messages and HTTP requests for a majority of the messaging, for which I developed the ActionScript handlers. In the past we had custom systems, using a C++ client to drive the user interface and a JavaScript middle layer to route messages between the client and server.

						<h2>Modeling and Simulation Engineer at BAE Systems</h2>
						<p class="subDetails">November 2003 - January 2007</p>
						<p>I worked as a Modeling and Simulation Software Engineer at United Defense/BAE Systems for 3 years developing the Advanced Gun System simulation system. The simulation system consisted of a 3D simulation rendered using Vega Prime software, multiple servers driving the simulation, and multiple user interface screens. My main role on the team was to develop and maintain the user interface system. I created screens using Java, Qt, and Microsoft's MFC and .NET. I also developed the messaging system between the 3D simulation and the servers and the messaging between the user interface and the servers. The user interface I developed received data to monitor the gun system and also controlled the gun system by sending commands. I also created a sound server to add in the extra dimension of sound to the simulation. The sound server was written using DirectSound and used a messaging system to control the simulation sounds.</p><p>Another major role on the Modeling and Simulation team I took on was the configuration management lead. The configuration management system we used was ClearCase, and my job consisted of maintaining views for peers, and managing the VOBs for the system.</p>

						<p>Evaluated existing satellite communications Ada/C code for reuse in an updated software system. Assessed air traffic control C Code for metrics violations and modified (or justified) the code which did not meet the coding metrics. Fixed C++ code bugs, implemented algorithms in C++ on radar system software.</p>
